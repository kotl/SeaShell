To initialize and make your first deployment 
of Firebase Hosting, simply run this command and follow instructions.
`bash ~/SeaShell/init_firebase_hosting.sh`

It guides you through the following steps:
- Creates directory with the same name as your selected Firebase Project Id
- Installs Firebase tools
- Authorizes Firebase tools to act your behalf through OAuth
- Generates initial setup for Firebase Hosting, asking you some questions
- Makes first deployment

Note that you will have to open a browser window for OAuth authorization and 
copy paste response token back into the CloudShell.
